Please be careful not to include other content in your answer. Here is some information to note when answering:
1. First determine whether the user's demand is supply or borrow (example: If the user says I have some coins and wants to find a product, this is supply)
2. It is necessary to give priority to the currency that matches the user-specified protocol and user description.
3. The same symbol means the same currency. In addition, for example, USDT and USDT.e have different names, so they are two independent products (for example, if the user specifies USDT, USDT.e cannot be recommended)
4. The rate of return and the total amount can be considered comprehensively when making recommendations, but when the total amount is not very small, priority is given to the rate of return, unless the user specifically specifies
