# DeFiBrain üß†

DeFiBrain is your ultimate DeFi investment AI assistant, harnessing the power of AI technology, NEAR multichain technology, and The Graph to discover DeFi products tailored to your needs.

### The Problem We Solved üí°

DeFi presents a plethora of investment options, but for individual investors, navigating this landscape can be overwhelming. With over 100 layer1s and numerous DeFi protocols, it's challenging for newcomers to find their way. DeFiBrain aims to empower investors by offering personalized recommendations and insights, facilitating informed decision-making in the dynamic DeFi space.

### How We Addressed It üöÄ

1. **Information Overload**: Our AI assistant filters through extensive data to pinpoint DeFi products that match the user's investment preferences and risk tolerance.

2. **Lack of Expertise**: Many investors lack the technical know-how or time for thorough research. DeFiBrain employs advanced AI algorithms to analyze various factors and suggest promising investment opportunities.

3. **Efficiency**: Manual searching for DeFi opportunities is tedious and inefficient. Our AI assistant streamlines the process by leveraging AI technology, NEAR multichain technology, and The Graph.

### Technologies We Used üõ†Ô∏è

- LLM: Leveraging advanced AI algorithms.
- Near Account: Utilizing NEAR multichain technology.
- The Graph: Enhancing data accessibility and analysis.

With DeFiBrain, dive into the world of DeFi with confidence and clarity! üåêüöÄ
